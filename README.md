Welcome to the repository for our paper: "STRFLNet: Spatio-Temporal Representation Fusion Learning Network for EEG-Based Emotion Recognition."

It is an end-to-end deep learning framework for classifying raw EEG signals. The SEED and SEED-IV datasets used by [STRFLNet](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/ta/5555/01/11168179/2a5v5k5tNDy) can be found on this [website](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/seed/).
